A lower RMSE indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, closer to the actual values, signifying higher accuracy and better fit to the underlying patterns in the electricity consumption data. While MAPE and RMSPE were also competitive, RMSE served as the primary selection criterion for its direct measure of prediction error magnitude."

This report provides an overview of the electricity demand forecasting analysis,

st.markdown("""
The forecasting process involved:
-   **Data Preprocessing:** Loading `Electricity Consumption.csv`, converting 'DATE' to datetime, and setting it as the index.
-   **Data Splitting:** Dividing data into training (Jan 1973 - Dec 2017) and testing (Jan 2018 - Dec 2019) sets for model validation.
-   **Model Implementation:** Comparing Decomposition, Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters), and SARIMA models.
-   **Error Metrics:** Evaluating models using RMSE, MAPE, and RMSPE.

st.header("6. Conclusion")
st.markdown("""
The Exponential Smoothing model provides reliable monthly forecasts for electricity demand for the next two years.
These estimations can be valuable for strategic planning, resource allocation, and operational management of electricity production to meet anticipated demand.
Further refinements could include incorporating external factors (e.g., temperature, economic indicators) and exploring more advanced models or ensemble methods for even greater accuracy.
